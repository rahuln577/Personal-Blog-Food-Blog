                p#cont <u>BUDGET SNACKS </u> <br>I  love garlic bread and when buying Juices we tend to usually order a side of chips as well as a side of garlic bread. We have been going to 'BUDGET SNACKS' for quite some time, several years to be exact but it wasn't until the other day when I placed an order while in store, rather than over the phone that I noticed that they sold cheesy garlic bread, and for the same price as the regular garlic bread which I was rather surprised about, usually you have to pay that little bit extra for such an item.
                p#cont2 <u>Ambience:</u><br> Visited this restaurant a few months ago. Must say the food and ambience is extremely worth it. The live band makes it even more interesting. The food and service were commendable. Had a good time with friends and familyThis is a perfect place for dine in for Family reunion or get togethers etc. They have amazing live singing shows which is really enjoyed by everyone. The food has also very nice variety.<br> <u>Quality and prices: </u><br>The place is run with a lot of efficiency .. though there is waiting most of the times but the gate staff handles the priority well .. a place is confirmed in some time.There are enough staff members to take care of guests .. menu is unique as it includes dishes prepared across cuisines .. now this is commendable in a eco friendly manner .. Bao, north Indian food, whole lot of desserts etc service is quick which is something you want in a busy place loads of seating areas and hence multiple 'ambiences' so to speak<br>The level of food prices differ from person to person depending on their perspectives on food. Some people think the prices are reasonable compared to the big portion that the restaurant is famous for. Other people reckon and opine that the prices are slightly high comparing to the quality of the food. In general prices are considered about the average if we take into account that dishes are made of fresh ingredients from scratch.It's a good place to have a hell loot of party with good ambience. Staff is really good in serving and politeness. Try to get seats at top floor<br> <u>PRICE RANGES FROM 50-100 PER PERSON</u>
