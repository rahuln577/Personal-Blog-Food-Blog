                    p#cont <u>SWEET CRAVINGS:</u> <br>Just wanted to relieve a childhood memory of eating this when someone bought this as a gift. Thankful for having the opportunity to eat this once more after all these years. I wouldn't say the product was not good but it wasn't great. This product is best in sweet and extremely good which is not how I remember my original experience years back. Still thanks for making this available.They have thr thickest shake on their menu.the shake was gooey and thick and was loaded with brownie .This dessert is full of nuts and pistachio cream. It gives you an middle Eastern dessert feeling . The ice cream was smooth and tasted well along the waffle cone..it was full of chocolate chips and brownies.<br>Gulab jamun truffle -I found it a bit try and not recommended.
                    p#cont2 <u>Ambience:</u><br>The inside chairs have cushions, so it is comfortable. However, the table is not big enough to put dishes on. Moreover, the tables and chairs are fixed, so if someone who sits inside wants to go to the restroom, everyone should stand up for him.The restaurant is clean and neat generally. Especially, the ladies’ restroom is very clean. Everything looked good until an experience I will never forget.I sat in the balcony for lunch and people who were beside my table just left at that time. As soon as the people were gone, 4-5 pigeons came to the table and ate leftovers with their beaks and they walked over the food and plates. On the plate, there was whipping cream so that the cream was stuck to pigeons’ feet (I took a picture of that). It was very disgusting. Afterward, I realized that they sometimes don’t clean food crumbs or stain on tables enough. If there is a specific threat to public health because of unsanitary conditions like this, you should contact Environmental Health.<br> <u>Quality and prices: </u><br>In my opinion, the fame and reputation of a restaurant do not depend on the variety only, but rely more on chefs ability and talent. So,  I prefer if the SWEET CRAVINGS restaurant becomes more careful about the high level talent of their chefs for every category.<br>The level of food prices differ from person to person depending on their perspectives on food. Some people think the prices are reasonable compared to the big portion that the restaurant is famous for. Other people reckon and opine that the prices are slightly high comparing to the quality of the food. In general prices are considered about the average if we take into account that dishes are made of fresh ingredients from scratch.<br> <u>PRICE RANGES FROM 50-100 PER PERSON</u>
