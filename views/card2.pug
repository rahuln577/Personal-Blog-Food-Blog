                    p#cont <u> THE OPEN HOUSE CAFE </u><br>The ‘Open House’ is a restaurant situated in the heart of a small village between three national forests and close to the horse´s capital city, Chantilly. It is the favourite hangout place for people from the polo, horse races, and golf world.It is also by far the best place for families and friends to spend a nice and quiet evening eating delicious home-made food.I had the opportunity to go there to celebrate my father’s birthday and I had a wonderful time.Quality time restaurant where you have eaten recently and would recommend to others.  
                    p#cont2 <u> Ambience:</u><br>As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting, a delightful marriage of antique cut stones and the luxuries of modernity.  Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshop-like kitchen where you can see the chefs working. For those who do not book a table and are waiting, there is a cosy lounge with aged leather armchairs and pictures of polo players displayed on the walls. <br><u>Quality and Prices:</u><br>he menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters. I had the white asparagus accompanied by a mousseline sauce and poached eggs, while my friend tried the zucchini carpaccio served with sundries tomatoes and a mozzarella strudel. They were exquisite. The main course consisted in a risotto with scallop cooked in cream and a cassolette of coley with mussels, which really thrilled us. It all was followed by a delicious apple pie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert. What a pity that the service does not accompany the high quality of the cooking. You can hardly get a smile out of the waitresses. Thankfully the owner and hostess, a middle-aged charming woman, is always around willing to exchange some kind words with all her clients.Despite the high price of the food and the not so attentive waiters´ service, I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. However, I have to say in their defence, that both of them were very young, kind and friendly.For this reason I highly recommend going to the Open House Cafe.<br><u>PRICES RANGE FROM 250-350 PER PERSON</u>
